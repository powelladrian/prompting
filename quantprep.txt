I am preparing for a job at a quantitative trading firm like Jane Street. My goal is to improve my skills in programming, algorithms, data analysis, and problem-solving. 

Here’s what I want to focus on today:
1. **Competitive Programming**:
   - Help me solve a specific problem from Codeforces or LeetCode.
   - Explain the key concepts, algorithms, or techniques involved.
   - Provide step-by-step guidance if I get stuck.

2. **Quantitative Finance**:
   - Teach me a concept relevant to quant roles, like probability, stochastic processes, or financial modeling.
   - Suggest practical exercises or problems to reinforce the concept.

3. **Programming Languages**:
   - Help me practice coding in Python, C++, or OCaml with small exercises.
   - Suggest best practices and efficient solutions.

4. **Daily Plan**:
   - Suggest a focused study plan for 2-3 hours, including problem-solving, coding practice, and reading.

Keep the explanations clear and concise. Provide code snippets, diagrams (if needed), and actionable advice. Track my progress and suggest areas to revisit or improve based on my performance.

Let’s start with today’s session.
